Sure! Here's a brief explanation of active voice and passive voice in English grammar, along with examples:

Active voice: In the active voice, the subject of the sentence is performing the action.
Example: John is washing the car.

In this sentence, "John" is the subject and he is performing the action of washing the car.

Passive voice: In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is not performing the action. Instead, the action is being done to the subject.
Example: The car is being washed by John.

In this sentence, "the car" is the subject, but it is not performing the action of washing. Instead, the action is being done to it by John.

Notice that the verb "wash" is in the present continuous form "is being washed" in the passive voice, and the subject "the car" comes before the verb.

Here's another example in the past tense:

Active voice: The dog chased the cat.

Passive voice: The cat was chased by the dog.

Notice that in the passive voice, the object "the cat" is now the subject of the sentence, and the verb "chased" is in the past tense "was chased".

In general, the passive voice is used when the focus is on the object being acted upon rather than the subject doing the action. It is also used to place emphasis on the action or to avoid assigning blame. However, the active voice is usually more direct and clear, and is generally preferred in most types of writing.
